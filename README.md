## Toggle the visibility of the master page
If you use pages in fireworks when export slices, you want to hide master page from all pages.
This command toggle the visibility of the master page.  


## Create retina slice
This command will take the working page and split them into 'Retina" page and 'Normal' page.
You will get a dialog window to define the postfix name to add to the slice names for the 'Retina' page. For example the postfix name can be "_2x".  

The slice names for both 'Retina' and 'Normal' pages will become btn_01_2x and btn_01 respectively. The 'Normal' page will downsize to 1/2 the size of the Retina page.
