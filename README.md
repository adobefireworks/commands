## Split to Retina and Normal pages
This command will take the working page and split them into 'Retina" page and 'Normal' page.
You will get a dialog window to define the postfix name to add to the slice names for the 'Retina' page. For example the postfix name can be "_2x".  

The slice names for both 'Retina' and 'Normal' pages will become btn_01_2x and btn_01 respectively. The 'Normal' page will downsize to 1/2 the size of the Retina page.
